# Reactlog 2.0: Debugging the State of Shiny

### Abstract

The revamped `reactlog` provides an updated visual display to traverse through the reactive behavior within your `shiny` application. Using live shiny applications, we will use `reactlog`’s directed dependency graph to find missing reactive dependencies in *“working”* applications and address suboptimal reactive coding patterns. Correcting these coding patterns will reduce the amount of calculations done by `shiny` and keep reactive objects from being created unnecessarily.
